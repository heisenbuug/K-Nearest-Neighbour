# K-Nearest-Neighbour
Implementation of K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm in Python with fail cases and special cases visualized using matplotlib

## K-Nearest-Neighbour
K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.

It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data).

I have also mentioned the case where this algo fails for k = 3
